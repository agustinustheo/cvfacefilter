# Face Filter
Add filters on face such as doggy faces or any other face filters (trying to go for Facebook or Instagram like features). This uses code and haar cascade classifiers supplied by opencv. 
  

We couldn't have assembled this rhetoric scoring model without the help of some awesome creators on the internet.
